# Venom Programming Language

Venom is aimed at being an interpreted object-oriented language, that combines the simplicity of Python's syntax with popular OOP features like private/public variables.

The project is likely not intended for actual use, but is purely intended to stretch my understanding of the implementation of programming languages

THe project was heavily inspired by [CodePulse's tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD).
